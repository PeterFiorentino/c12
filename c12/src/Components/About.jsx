                        The Courier Twelve Screenwriting Contest is a one of a kind
                        opportunity. Unlike any other screenwriting contest, Courier
                        Twelve is partnering with (TALENT NAME HERE) to find the
                        next great small budget, feature screenplay to PRODUCE.

                        After years of submitting to contests themselves, the Courier
                        Twelve team realized that screenwriting contests were missing a
                        great opportunity. Finding the next great writer and script isnâ€™t
                        enough, we should be finding the next indie script to go into
                        production with.

                        obtained an investment of $2,000,000 to cover the

                        Because of our low budget, we cannot choose a big budget
                        screenplay. We will gladly read your buddy-cop action
                        adventure set in space with big explosions and spaceship
                        chases but it will not be able to win.
